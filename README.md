This is the repository that contains all the codes that i have used in my scientific project funded by FAPESP. From radio programming, data analysis and even virtualization of data stored in the datalogger.

Mangrove forests play a crucial role in sequestering atmospheric carbon and maintaining coastal biodiversity. However, these ecosystems are under constant threat due to human activities such as deforestation and sea-level rise.In-situ measurements are essential to support monitoring efforts for remote sensing. Given the isolation of mangroves, the development of a network of sensors is necessary to facilitate real-time environmental data collection. For this network to function effectively, it is essential to understand signal propagation in these environments in order to improve sensor placement and ensure network resilience. 

Furthermore, to help the researchers that analyze those datas, I am virtualizing the data extraction by connecting the Campbell Datalogger that they use to collecting the sensor data to the internet using an Network Link Interface (NL201) connected to a Raspberry Pi, that works as a FTP server, via Ethernet.

This study aims to improve a signal attenuation and propagation model specifically for mangrove areas. Preliminary tests will be completed in the Cananéia mangroves, on the southern coast of São Paulo State.
